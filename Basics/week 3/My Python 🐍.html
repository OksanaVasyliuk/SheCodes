        Python is a computer programming language often used to build websites
        and software, automate tasks, and conduct data analysis. Python is a
        general-purpose language, meaning it can be used to create a variety of
        different programs and isn‚Äôt specialized for any specific problems. This
        versatility, along with its beginner-friendliness, has made it one of
        the most-used programming languages today. A survey conducted by
        industry analyst firm RedMonk found that it was the second-most popular
        programming language among developers in 2021

        The name Python comes from Monty Python. When Guido van Rossum was
        creating Python, he was also reading the scripts from BBC's Monty
        Python's Flying Circus. He thought the name Python was appropriately
        short and slightly mysterious.
